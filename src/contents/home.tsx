          <hr />
          <p>
            Ambergris, often called "floating gold," is one of the most valuable ingredients in luxury perfumery. 
            Traditionally sourced from sperm whales, this rare substance has been prized for centuries for its 
            unique ability to enhance and fix fragrances. Our team is pioneering a synthetic biology approach 
            to produce ambergris sustainably, eliminating the need for whale-derived materials while maintaining 
            the exceptional quality that makes this ingredient so coveted.
